<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> In adhesion contracts, an arbitration clause will only be valid if the adhering party takes the initiative to file an arbitration proceeding or if it expressly agrees with its initiation, as long as it is in an attached written document or in boldface type, with a signature or special approval for that clause.</p>
<p><em><strong>Paragraph 3.</strong> (Vetoed by message 162 of May 26, 2015).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Paragraph 4.</strong> (Vetoed by message 162 of May 26, 2015).</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5.</strong> If the arbitration clause makes reference to the rules of a particular arbitral institution or specialized entity, the arbitration shall commence and be conducted in accordance with such rules. The parties may also agree in the arbitration clause or in a separate document, the procedure for the commencement of arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Article 6.</strong> In the event of absence of provision as to the method of commencing the arbitration, the interested party shall notify the other party, either by mail or by any other means of communication, with confirmation of receipt, of its intention to commence arbitral proceedings, and to set up a date, time and place for the execution of the submission agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Sole Paragraph.</strong> If the notified party fails to appear, or if it appears but refuses to sign the submission agreement, the other party may file a lawsuit as provided in Article 7 of this Law, before the judicial authority originally competent to hear the case.</p>
<p><strong>Article 7.</strong> If there is an arbitration clause and there is objection for the commencement of arbitration, the interested party may request that the other party be served with process to appear in court so that the submission agreement is drawn up. The court judge will designate a special hearing for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1.</strong> The plaintiff will accurately define the subject matter of arbitration, including in its request the document that contains the arbitration clause.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> If the parties show up at the hearing, the judge shall first try to bring the parties into a settlement. If this is not successful, the judge will lead the parties for a consensual submission agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3.</strong> If the parties fail to agree on the terms of submission agreement, after hearing the party against whom the request is filed, the judge shall determine on the contents of the submission agreement, either at the hearing or within ten days there from, in accordance with the wording of the arbitration clause, taking into account the provisions of Articles 10 and 21 Paragraph 2 of this Law.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 7.</strong> The court ruling that grants the plaintiff's request will be considered the submission agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Article 8.</strong> An arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.</p>
<p><strong>Sole paragraph.</strong> The arbitrator has jurisdiction to decide ex officio or at the parties' request, the issues concerning the existence, validity and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement, as well as the contract containing the arbitration clause.</p>
<p><strong>Article 9.</strong> The submission agreement is the judicial or extrajudicial agreement by which the parties submit an existing dispute to arbitration by one or more persons.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1.</strong> The judicial submission agreement shall be entered into by a written instrument registered within the dockets of the case before the court where the suit was filed.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> An extrajudicial arbitration agreement shall be entered into by a private written instrument signed by two witnesses, or by a public notary.</p>
<p><strong>Article 10.</strong> The arbitration agreement must contain:</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> – The name, profession, marital status and domicile of the parties;</p>

<p><strong>IV</strong> – An indication of national law or institutional rules applicable to the arbitration, if agreed upon by the parties;</p>
<p><strong>V</strong> – A statement regarding the responsibility for the fees and costs of the arbitral proceedings; and</p>
<p><strong>VI</strong> – The fees of the arbitrator or arbitrators.</p>
<p><strong>Sole paragraph.</strong> By setting up the arbitrator or arbitrators' fees in the submission agreement, such document will be considered an enforceable extrajudicial instrument. In the absence of such provision, the arbitrator will request the court with original jurisdiction to hear the case to rule upon the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Article 12.</strong> The arbitration agreement is terminated:</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> – If either arbitrator excuses himself prior to accepting his appointment, as long as the parties have expressly declared that they will not accept substitution;</p>
<p><strong>II</strong> – If either arbitrator dies or becomes unable to act as such, as long as the parties have expressly declared that they will not accept substitution; and</p>
<p><strong>III</strong> – Upon expiration of the time limit referred to in Article 11, item III, as long as the interested party has notified the arbitrator, or the president of the arbitral tribunal, granting a further period of ten days to render and present the arbitral award.</p>

It is however preserved the arbitral institution's control over the appointment of arbitrators. In the event of impasse and with multiparty arbitration, the respective applicable institutional rules shall be observed. If several arbitrators have been appointed they shall elect, by majority, the president of the arbitral tribunal. In the absence of an agreement, the eldest will be the president.

<p><strong>Article 14.</strong> Individuals somehow linked to the parties or to the submitted dispute, by any of the relationships that characterize the impediment or suspicion of judges, are prevented from serving as arbitrators and become subject, as the case may be and to the applicable extent, to the same duties and responsibilities incurred by court judges, as set up in the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1.</strong> Prior to accepting the service, an individual appointed to serve as arbitrator shall disclose any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> A party may challenge the appointed-arbitrator only for reasons of which it becomes aware after the appointment has been made, unless:<br>
a)	The arbitrator was not appointed directly by the party; or<br>
b)	The reason for the challenge of the arbitrator becomes known subsequent to the appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Article 15.</strong> The party who intends to challenge the arbitrator shall, pursuant to Article 20, present the respective motion either directly to the arbitrator or to the president of the arbitral tribunal, setting forth their reasons with the pertinent evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sole paragraph.</strong> If the motion is granted, the arbitrator will be removed and replaced in accordance with Article 16 of this Law.</p>
<p><strong>Article 16.</strong> If an arbitrator withdraws prior to accepting the appointment, or if the arbitrator dies after acceptance, becomes unable to carry out his duties or is successfully challenged, the alternate indicated in the arbitration agreement, if any, will assume their position.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> In the absence of any arbitration agreement and if the parties fail to reach an agreement as to the appointment of the substitute arbitrator, the interested party shall proceed in the manner set forth in Article 7 of this Law, unless the parties have expressly stated in the arbitration agreement that they will not accept a substitute arbitrator.</p>

<p><strong>Article 18.</strong> An arbitrator is the judge in fact and in law, and his award is not subject to appeal or recognition by judicial court.</p>


<h4 class="text-center"><strong>Chapter IV</strong></h4>
<p class="text-center">Arbitration Proceedings</p>
<p><strong>Article 19.</strong> The arbitration shall be deemed to be commenced when the appointment is accepted by the sole arbitrator or by all of the arbitrators, if there is more than one.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1.</strong> Once the arbitration has been commenced, and if the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal concludes there is a need to clarify a matter set forth in the arbitration agreement, an addendum will be drafted together with the parties, executed by all, and will become an integral part of the arbitration agreement. <em>(Added by Law n<sup style="text-decoration:underline">o</sup>. 13,129 of 2015)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> The commencement of arbitration tolls the statute of limitations, retroactive to the date of the filing of the request for arbitration, even if the arbitration is terminated due to absence of jurisdiction. (Added by Law n<sup style="text-decoration:underline">o</sup>. 13,129 of 2015)</em></p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 2.</strong> When the challenge is not accepted, the arbitration shall proceed normally, subject however to review of that decision by the competent Judicial Authority if a lawsuit referred to in Article 33 of this Law is filed.</p>
<p><strong>Article 21.</strong> The sole arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal shall comply with the procedure agreed upon by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which may refer to the rules of an arbitral institution or specialized entity, it being possible for the parties to empower the sole arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal to regulate the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1.</strong> In the absence of any provisions on the procedure, the sole arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in such a manner it considers appropriate.</p>
