						<h3 class="text-uppercase"><strong>ARBITRATION RULES</strong></h3>
<p> <strong>1. SUBMISSION TO THE PRESENT RULES</strong> </p>
<p>1.1. Parties wishing to submit, upon execution of an arbitration agreement, any disputes to the Ciesp/Fiesp Chamber of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, hereinafter referred to as Chamber, hereby accept and become bound by the present Rules and the Chamber's Internal Regulation.</p>
<p>1.2. Any change in the provisions hereunder, as agreed between the parties, shall only be valid for the specific case.</p>
<p>1.3. The Chamber does not resolve disputes itself. It administers the development of arbitral proceedings by nominating and appointing arbitrator(s), unless otherwise agreed between the parties.</p>
<p>1.4.	These Rules shall apply whenever the arbitration agreement determines submission to the arbitration rules set out by the Ciesp/Fiesp Chamber of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, Ciesp/Fiesp Chamber of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration of São Paulo, the São Paulo Chamber of Mediation and Arbitration, the Fiesp Chamber of Arbitration, or whenever it refers to any Chamber of Arbitration belonging to any of Ciesp and Fiesp entities.</p>
<p><strong>2. PRELIMINARY ACTIONS</strong> </p>
<p>2.1. The arbitral proceedings shall be initiated upon request by the interested party, which shall, from the outset, mention the arbitration agreement stating the reference of the matter to arbitration administered by the Chamber, the subject matter of the arbitration, the amount of the dispute, the name and full identification of the other party(ies), attaching a copy of the contract and any other documents relevant to the dispute.</p>
<p>2.2. The Secretariat of the Chamber shall send a copy of the request to the other party(ies), inviting them to nominate an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days, in accordance with the arbitration agreement, and shall send its List of Arbitrators, in addition to a copy of these Rules and of the Code of Ethics. The opposing party(ies) shall have an identical time limit to nominate an arbitrator.</p>
<p>2.3. The Secretariat of the Chamber shall inform the parties about the nomination of an arbitrator by the opposing party and shall request the submission of this arbitrator's résumé, except if he/she is a member of the List of Arbitrators.</p>
<p>2.4. The president of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be elected by mutual agreement of the arbitrators nominated by the parties, preferably from among the members of the Chamber's List of Arbitrators. The names shall be subject to approval of the President of the Chamber. The approved arbitrators shall be notified to express their acceptance and to execute the Statement of Independence, whereupon the arbitral proceedings are deemed to have commenced. The Secretariat, within ten (10) days from receipt of the arbitrators' confirmation, shall notify the parties to draft the Terms of Reference.</p>
<p>2.5. Should either party fail to nominate an arbitrator within the time limit provided in item 2.2, the President of the Chamber shall make the appointment. In the absence of such nomination, the President of the Chamber shall also appoint, preferably from among the members of the Chamber's List of Arbitrators, the arbitrator who shall act as President of the Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p>2.6.	The Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of three (3) arbitrators, and the parties may agree that the dispute shall be settled by a sole arbitrator, nominated by them, within fifteen (15) days. If no nomination is made within said time period, the arbitrator shall be designated by the President of the Chamber, preferably from among the members of the List of Arbitrators.</p>
<p>2.7.	The commencement of an arbitration to be resolved by a sole arbitrator shall follow the same procedure described in these Rules for arbitrations with three arbitrators (Arbitral Tribunal).</p>
<p><strong>3. MULTIPLE PARTIES ARBITRATION</strong> </p>

Where there are multiple parties as claimants or respondents (multiple parties arbitrations), the multiple claimants, jointly, or the multiple respondents, jointly, shall mutually agree to nominate an arbitrator, in accordance with items 2.1 to 2.5. If the parties fail to agree, the President of the Chamber shall appoint all the arbitrators to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>4. <em>PRIMA FACIE</em> DECISION</strong> </p>
<p>4.1.	The President of the Chamber shall conduct a preliminary examination, i.e., a prima facie analysis, before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, on matters related to the existence, validity, effectiveness and scope of the arbitration agreement, as well as to the consolidation of claims and to the extension of the arbitration clause, granted that the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide on its jurisdiction, by either confirming or changing the decision of the Presidency.</p>
<p><strong>5. THE TERMS OF REFERENCE</strong> </p>
<p>5.1.	The Terms of Reference shall be prepared by the Secretariat of the Chamber together with the arbitrators and the parties, and shall include the names and identification of the parties, their counsel and the arbitrators, the place where the award is to be issued, whether it is permitted to judge the subject matter of the dispute on an ex aequo et bono basis, the amount of the claim, and the liability for payment of court costs, experts' and arbitrators' fees, as well as the statement that the Arbitral Tribunal is bound by the Terms of Reference and these Rules.</p>
<p>5.2.	The parties shall execute the Terms of Reference together with the arbitrators and a representative of the Chamber. The Terms of Reference shall be filed by the Chamber. Absence of signature by either party shall not prevent the regular continuation of the arbitration.</p>
<p>5.3.	Following the execution of the Terms of Reference, the parties shall not be authorized to introduce other claims, except as approved by the Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>6. SUBMISSION AGREEMENT</strong> </p>
<p>6.1.	In the absence of an arbitration clause, if the parties wish to submit their dispute to arbitration, a submission agreement may be executed by the parties.</p>

<p>7.2.	The person appointed to act as arbitrators shall disclose in writing any facts or circumstances whose nature may give rise to justified doubts on the arbitrator's Independence and Impartiality. The Chamber shall communicate such information to the parties in writing and set a time limit for them to submit their respective remarks thereon.</p>
<p>7.3.	If, at any time, an arbitrator is challenged or requested to be disqualified, a time limit shall be assigned for the arbitrator (and also the parties, if they so wish) to present their comments. The matter shall be decided by a committee made up of three (3) members from the Chamber's List of Arbitrators, appointed by the President of the Chamber.</p>
<p>7.4.	If, during the arbitral proceedings, any reasons justifying disqualification of arbitrators arise based on impediment or suspected bias, or in the event of death or incapacity of an arbitrator, the latter shall be replaced by another, appointed by the same party and, as the case might be, by the President of the Chamber, under the present Rules.</p>
<p>7.5.	Arbitrators, in fulfilling their mission, shall not only be independent and impartial, but also discrete, diligent, competent, and shall also comply with the Code of Ethics.</p>

<p>9.4.	The Arbitral Tribunal may set time limits for compliance with procedural orders. The time limits hereunder may be modified, at the discretion of either the Arbitral Tribunal or the President of the Chamber, in what regards item 2.2 (nomination of arbitrator).</p>
<p>9.5.	In the absence of a time limit for a specific action, a five-day (5) deadline shall apply.</p>
<p>9.6.	Documents in a foreign language shall be translated into Portuguese by means of free translation, as needed, at the discretion of the President of the Chamber or the Arbitral Tribunal.</p>

The parties shall be informed of the procedure and shall take the relevant actions for the regular development of the arbitration.</p>
<p>10.2.	In the Terms of Reference, the parties and the arbitrators may agree on time limits for submissions and documents, and establish a provisional timetable of events.

<p>10.7.	The proceedings shall continue to develop notwithstanding a default from either party, provided that such party had been duly notified to take part in the proceedings and all subsequent actions. No arbitral award shall be based on the party's default.</p>
<p><strong>11. ACTS OUTSIDE THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION (PLACE OF ARBITRATION)</strong> </p>
